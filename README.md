# Generation-of-Music-Using-Deep-Learning


The dataset used in this project is a subset of the piano music avaialble in the MAESTRO dataset. The models don't try to generate multi-instrument music. The focus has been on learning structural patterns to create sequences for single instrument (piano) music.
This project primarily aims to compare two deep learning techniques in the task of learning musical styles and generating novel musical content. An LSTM model and a GAN model were evaluated using a survey which helped in obtaining an Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which was used as an indicator of the comparative quality and performance of the models. The MIDI files were processed using the Music21 library.
